# A Space is a collection of pages. It stores objects, the data for the objects,
# not references. See Page for more detail.

# Pages are stored by the object size they represent in a hash.

# Space and Page work together in making *new* objects available.
# "New" is slightly misleading in that normal operation only ever
# recycles objects.
