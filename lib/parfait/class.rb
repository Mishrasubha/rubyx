# A class describes the capabilities of an object, ie what data it has
# and functions it responds to
#
# An Object carries the data for the instance variables it has
# The Layout lists the names of the instance variables
# The class keeps a list of instance methods, these have a name and code
# The class also keeps a list of class methods (with names+code)
# Class methods are instance methods on the class object

# So it is essential that the class (the object defining the class)
# can carry methods. It does so as instance variables.
# In fact this property is implemented in the Object, as methods
# may be added to any object at run-time

class Class
