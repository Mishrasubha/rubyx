# Class derives from and derives most of it's functionality (that you would associate with a class)
# from there

# A Class is a module that can be instantiated

# An Object carries the data for the instance variables it has
# The Layout lists the names of the instance variables
# The class keeps a list of instance methods, these have a name and code

class Class < Module
  # ruby 2.1 list (just for reference, keep at bottom)
  #:allocate, :new, :superclass
end
