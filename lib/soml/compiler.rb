  # Compiling is the conversion of the AST into 2 things:
  # - code (ie sequences of Instructions inside Methods)
  # - an object graph containing all the Methods, their classes and Constants
  #
  # Some compile methods just add code, some may add Instructions while
  # others instantiate Class and Method objects
  #
  # Everything in ruby is an statement, ie returns a value. So the effect of every compile
  # is that a value is put into the ReturnSlot of the current Message.
  # The compile method (so every compile method) returns the value that it deposits.
  #
  # The process uses a visitor pattern (from AST::Processor) to dispatch according to the
  # type the statement. So a s(:if xx) will become an on_if(node) call.
  # This makes the dispatch extensible, ie Expressions may be added by external code,
  # as long as matching compile methods are supplied too.
  #
  # A compiler can also be used to generate code for a method without AST nodes. In the same way
  # compile methods do, ie adding Instructions etc. In this way code may be generated that
  # has no code equivalent.
  #
  # The Compiler also keeps a list of used registers, from which one may take to use and return to
  # when done. The list may be reset.
  #
  # The Compiler also carries method and class instance variables. The method is where code is
  # added to (with add_code). To be more precise, the @current instruction is where code is added
  # to, and that may be changed with set_current

  # All Statements reset the registers and return nil.
  # Expressions use registers and return the register where their value is stored.

  # Helper function to create a new compiler and compie the statement(s)
