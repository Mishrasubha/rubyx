# The *essential* step from vool to risc, is the one from a language to a machine. From statements
# that hang in the air, to an instruction set.
# 
# ### Tree based:  So almost 1-1 from vool
#
# ### Use object memory :  object to object transfer + no registers
#
# ### Instruction based
#
# So a machine than language. No control structures, but compare and jump instructions.
# No send or call, just objects and jump.
# Machine capabilities (instructions) for basic operations. Use of macros for higher level.
