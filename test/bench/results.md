# Benchmarks

loop  - program does empty loop of same size as hello
hello - output hello world (to dev/null) to measure kernel calls (not terminal speed)
itos  - convert integers from 1 to 100000  to string
add   - run integer adds by linear fibonacci of 40
call  - exercise calling by recursive fibonacci of 20

Hello and puti and add run 100_000 iterations per program invocation to remove startup overhead.
Call only has 10000 iterations, as it much slower

Gcc used to compile c on the machine
soml produced by ruby (on another machine)

# Results

Results were measured by a ruby script. Mean and variance was measured until variance was low,
usually under one percent.

The machine was a virtual arm run on a powerbook, performance roughly equivalent to a raspberry pi.
But results should be seen as relative, not absolute.
